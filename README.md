# belly-button-challenge

For this challenge, I relied heavily on the assistance of others. I had a tutor session with a gentlement named Paddington who helped me populate the dropdown menu.
We also used sources such as stackoverflow and w3 schools to point me in the right direction.

Also, for the rest of the assignment, (the barchart, demographic info, and bubble chart) I worked with a classmate, and we shared our code with each other.

Finally, I would like to note that for the final step of the assignment that required us to deploy my app to a free static page hosting service in github pages wasn't working for me.
